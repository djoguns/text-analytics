## Text Analytics
Text analytics (~ text mining) is a heterogeneous research field that focuses on extraction of meaningful patterns from unstructured and text-heavy data. The meaningful patterns are typically extracted by applying statistical learning (i.e., machine learning) to target data sets from large non-relational databases. In this one-day introductory course, we will go through a generic text analytics pipeline with particular focus on available tools for data preparation and analysis.
